Most people get the accountant to help them lodge the annual tax return. There's a couple of slight wrinkles here potentially. One is if people buy property in a trust instead of their own name. And a sort of related issue is land tax which doesn't generally have an impact on somebody buying a home but sometimes an investor buying an investment property might have some land tax to pay as well. Yeah, I think you just got to be careful with land tax because it is a state-based tax and there's certain thresholds that each individual or maybe if you buy properties as a couple then you can get two thresholds. And so it's really important that to give you an idea though you're probably going to need a fair decent asset to go over these land tax thresholds.

If you're looking to buy a property adoption and when the hammer falls, if you're the highest bidder and you're the successful bidder, then effectively you're going to be taking ownership of that property. So you need to be 100% clear whether you're buying in your own name or buying jointly with a partner or buying in a trust or a different structure. If you need to have your financing in place and you need to be, as Amy said, you need to be 100% clear that you've done your building and pest inspections, your full due diligence because there's no backing out when you buy an auction.

And there was a stamp duty exemption for first home buyers in Australia back then. So similar challenge, can't buy the place you want to live in. And then you've got a real decision to make, particularly as you mentioned as a home buyer, because you've got to basically buy something that fulfills your living needs for the foreseeable future. That's absolutely right. So when we're looking at purchasing a property, first of all, we need to understand any financial constraints. So whatever your budget is, whether it's $300,000 or $600 or $2 million, ultimately, that's then a case of assessing, okay, well, this is my budget at\", metadata={'start': 42.32, 'end': 610.32, 'podcast': 'australian_property_podcast', 'episode': '🧠_buying_a_property_on_a_budget_with_amy_lunardi_pete_wargent'}),\n",

So I'll give you a recent example of a purchase that we did in a suburb called Cooparoo in Brisbane. So just for the sake of round numbers, it was a house. It was a million dollar purchase or thereabouts. And when we made the offer, so we had the contract reviewed by the solicitor we did all our due diligence. We did all our research in terms of comparable sales. We offered a million dollars just for the sake of rounding it off to a round number. But the offer was made subject to finance and subject to a satisfactory building and pest inspection within 10 business days. So what that does, it buys you a bit of breathing space.

Go and get yourself pre-approved. Depending on what choice of banks you have, sometimes you've got lots of choice. Every bank would take you on, or sometimes you've got two or three lenders because something in your situation is a little bit quirky or maybe it's you've got a lot of commission incomes or maybe you're on a contract or maybe it's a higher LVR or et cetera. And so you might have to, you get pre-approved with one bank, but you're not obligated to use that bank. And that pre-approval would usually last three to six months.

You go to the sold section. Don't stay too much in the for sale section at the start because as we all know what properties are listed for, they don't necessarily sell for. The sold section is a gold mine because if you can see properties that you can afford that you like selling in those suburbs a couple of times a month, that demonstrates you've got a feasible and achievable brief.
